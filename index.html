                <h2>Josh Bundy</h2>
                    <p>Josh is a degenerate weeb who spends too much time at his computer. He has spent the last three years trying to deside 
                    with his life, changing career paths multiple times over 3 years. He is currently chasing a degree in Computer Science 
                    with a plan to go into Game design in the future.</p>
                    <p>His free time is spent playing video games and trying to stay caught up on the current seasons animes. He doesnt go
                    out and do things too often, friends to do stuff with. That being said, he also doesn't like being couped up inside for
                    lng periods of time either.</p>
