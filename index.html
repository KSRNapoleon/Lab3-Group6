                    <p>My name is Karin Bryant, and this is my first class in the last couple years. I have a degree in Biochemistry and worked in the field for 9 years before moving to Portland to start a family. Once our three kids were in school, I completed a <a href=” https://www.pdx.edu/sba/post-baccalaureate-accounting-certificate” target=”_blank”> Post-baccalaureate accounting certificate </a> to before starting paid work as a financial auditor.</p>
                    <p>When we moved to Portland, my husband and I bought a fixer upper which we have been working on for the past 20 years. Otherwise, most of our time is spent with our kids and their activities. In a couple years our youngest will be in college and we hope to do more exploring within Oregon and beyond.</p>
