                    with his life, changing career paths multiple times over 3 years. He is currently chasing a degree in Computer Science 
                    with a plan to go into Game Design in the future.</p>
                    <p>His free time is spent playing video games and trying to stay caught up on the current seasons anime. He doesnt go
                    out and do things too often,lacking friends to do stuff with. That being said, he also doesn't like being couped up inside 
                    for long periods of time either. When not behind the computer, he's playing with is dog in the yard.</p>
